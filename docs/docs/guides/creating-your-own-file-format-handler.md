# Handling a File Format

There are instances where you might need to support custom file formats for reading data into a nodestream pipeline's `FileExtractor`.
This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own file format implementation for your project.

## Define Your File Format Class

To create your own file format, you need to define a class that implements the required behavior.
Let's say we want to create a file format for reading JSON files. Here's an example implementation:

```python
import yaml
from io import StringIO
from typing import Iterable

from nodestream.extractors.files import SupportedFileFormat

class YamlFileFormat(SupportedFileFormat, alias=".yaml"):
    def read_file_from_handle(self, fp: StringIO) -> Iterable[dict]:
        return [yaml.safe_load(fp)]
```

In this example, `YamlFileFormat` is a class that reads a YAML file from a file handle (`fp`) and returns an
iterable of dictionaries representing the YAML document. In order to support your file format, you need to
implement the method `read_file_from_handle`. This method reads the file and returns the data in a desired format.

The method signature should match the expected behavior of the project or the specific module you're working with.
In our example, the `read_file_from_handle` method takes a `StringIO` file handle and returns an iterable of dictionaries.

## Register Your File Format

File Formats are registered via the `entry_points` API of a Python Package. Specifically, the `entry_point` named
`file_formats` inside of the `nodestream.plugins` group is loaded. It is expected to be a subclass of
`nodestream.extractors.files:SupportedFileFormat` as directed above.

The `entry_point` should be a module that contains at least one file format class. At runtime, the module will be loaded
and all classes that inherit from `nodestream.extractors.files:SupportedFileFormat` will be registered. The `alias`
attribute of the class will be used as the name of the file format. For example, the `YamlFileFormat` class above has
an `alias` of `.yaml`. This means that the file format can be referenced in the `format` configuration option of the
`FileExtractor` as `.yaml`. Additionally, files that end with `.yaml` will automatically be detected as files that
should be parsed with the `YamlFileFormat`.

Depending on how you are building your package, you can register your file format plugin in one of the following ways:

=== "pyproject.toml"
    ```toml
    [project.entry-points."nodestream.plugins"]
    file_formats = "nodestream_plugin_cool.file_formats"
    ```

=== "pyproject.toml (poetry)"
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.plugins."nodestream.plugins"]
    file_formats = "nodestream_plugin_cool.file_formats"
    ```

=== "setup.cfg"
    ```ini
    [options.entry_points]
    nodestream.plugins =
        file_formats = nodestream_plugin_cool.file_formats
    ```

=== "setup.py"
    ```python
    setup(
        ...
        entry_points={
            "nodestream.plugins": [
                "file_formats = nodestream_plugin_cool.file_formats"
            ]
        },
        ...
    )
    ```
